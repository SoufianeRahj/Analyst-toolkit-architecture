# Analyst-toolkit-architecture
The Analyst-toolkit application aims at easing the work of business analysts. 

It helps delivering high quality specifications by removing typos, enhancing the vocabulary, and translating the content.

[WORK IN PROGRESS]: the translation and typos removal features are available as of now. To test the application, email me at soufianerahj23@gmail.com. 

For infrastructure cost reasons I don't keep the application UP 24/24.
